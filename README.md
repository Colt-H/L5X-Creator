Program for generating L5x files for Allen Bradley PLCs. 

This tool will create an L5x file to be imported into a blank project. Create the basics of the project without dealing with AB's slow interface. Generate your IO tree, configure the controller, and more. Future features include settings file to automatically populate from.
